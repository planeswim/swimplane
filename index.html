            <p>As a freshmen student at Diamond Bar High School, I am currently taking the Aglebra Two/Trignometry Honors class. I choosed to take this particular math class as I enjoy math and wanted to challenge myself, espicially in learning math skills. Furthermore, I seek a potential future in a field of engineering, and after learning from many others, high level math courses are beneficial for engineering classes and the engineering field.</p>

            <p>I am also currently taking computer systems, whichs is a class geared towards leanring industry standard applications like Microsoft Word, Microsoft Powerpoint, Micorsoft Excel, and Microsoft Access. The class has and will continue to help understand the proper tools to accurately and effective complete STEM task whether that be documenting research or creating a proposal of a new design. Ultimately, the class will allow to be successful in my high school engineering career and the future.</p>

            <p>Introduction to Desgin 1,2 is a engineering class focusing and teaching about the basics of engineering such 3D modeling, time management, data analysis, and more. It is a crucial step in helping with my development in the engineering field , espicially that's a potential major that I would like to persure after highschool.</p>

                    <td>This year I partipated in the California Mathmatics League test, and it a six question every month which focuses and test one knowledge on mathmatics by asking interesting math questions. The test has challenged how I anylaze questions and how to respond to them, and these skills can be useful when engineering or completing tasks in the STEM field as everything uses mathmatics(like measurements or analysis)

                    National History Day is a yearlong project where students find a topic relating to the year's theme and create a arguement to go with a project(the project can be a poster board, documentary, essay,website, or even a pefromation). This year I created and completed a Essay for National History Day competition. Even though National History Day may not have direct connections with STEM, the project provides vital skills that can be applied and beneficial in STEM such as proffesional writing, reasearch, use of technology, and much more.Therefore, it can be ery beneficial activity for STEM.

            <h5>These are the potential career paths I am seeking in the future:</h5>
    <ol>
        <li class="key-format">Aerospace Engineering</li>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Atlantis_on_Shuttle_Carrier_Aircraft.jpg/440px-Atlantis_on_Shuttle_Carrier_Aircraft.jpg" width="100" alt="Image of the Space Shuttle carrier with a space shuttle on top">
        <p>I am interested in majoring in Aerospace Engineering as it combines my interests in planes and technology in the air with my other interest in engineering. Therefore it seems very interesting major, and one that I would enjoy</p>
        <li class="key-format">Business and Management</li>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Society.svg/400px-Society.svg.png" width="100" alt="Image of people gathering and having a meeting regarding business">
        <p>Business and Management is next on the list as I am slightly interested in working a potential business and managing it.</p>
        <li class="key-format">Mechanical Engineering</li>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Cad_crank.jpg/440px-Cad_crank.jpg" width="100" alt="Image of Engine Pistons">
        <p>As a student interested in engineering, I wouldn't mind taken another engineering course as my major, and I ultimately choose mechanical for my third options as I find the mechanics of the simple things very interesting.</p>
